In my job role I work in a network support role where we deal with networks, phones, leased lines, and occasionally IT support, for mainly serviced offices across the UK and EU. In the role I work at, there is a consistent requirement for knowledge of networking including network fundamentals, switch and router configuration and commands, VOIP handsets, wireless and wired devices, port types, VLANs, port forwarding, firewalls, protocols etc. We deal with all issues and support including installs and site visits. The level of accuracy we need when making changes or looking into issues is quite high as small changes can knock out networks, cause interruption or interference, or worst case, take down an entire site.

In my job role, security is extremely important and it is essential that all of us have an understanding of it, ignoring safety by, for example, putting a port forward out to the entire world, can cause attackers to get into networks and breach security, since we can easily make these changes it is important that we do it with care and a knowledge of what can happen if it were to be done wrong.

This quiz will be relevant to my job role and helpful to us as it will reinforce knowledge of networking and security so we can minimize the number of mistakes made and prevent any longer term issues, since these can be hard to track down and find the source, this will prevent them from happening in the first place since we will know what to avoid and how to do things as safely as possible and as efficiently as possible, we also need to know what to push back on if a client were to request something unsafe to be changed.
